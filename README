Dust-B-Gone
===========

Cleans your Bitcoin-QT wallet of unwanted dust.

Usage:

./dust-b-gone.py

You can use the --tor option to use your local Tor proxy for added privacy.


What happens to all that dust?
==============================

Every dust txout is collected into a single transaction sending all the funds
to mining fees, and that transaction is signed with the ANYONECANPAY flag.
That flag means anyone else can add inputs to the transaction. Your transaction
is then sent to Peter Todd's server, where a script collects it and other
transactions from other people together periodically and merges them into a
single transaction, destroying the dust.

Because multiple people's dust is merged in one go no-one can tell where it
came from, and thus what coins are connected to what, protecting your privacy.


I restarted Bitcoin and the dust came back!
===========================================

Your dusty txouts aren't mined immediately; it takes some time for other people
to submit their dust for collection too. While dust-b-gone *temporarily*
"locks" the transaction outputs being cleaned from your wallet, those locks
don't persist after a restart. Don't worry though: the dust will be cleaned up
sooner or later.
